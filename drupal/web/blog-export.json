It was in some section of St Paul that we were unfamiliar with and of course I have a lot of nightmares about getting lost in St Paul, so I tend to keep out of the city for fear my dreams might be there somewhere maybe in West St Paul where Stu Mead lived (with and without Mary Esch). So Grant Hart died recently which was a very sad event in the history of this place. I posted my portrait the day Grant died, I never knew if he liked it?

Even when my work is a portrait it still often can be distressing and intense psychologically as well as image wise. Besides selling portraits is very difficult who wants a stranger on their bed room walls ? Within the context of the shows Jim did in Telluride was a video about James Hayward (Jim) and his paintings in which he pointed out a painting he bought from me mostly for Belgium oil paints though some cash was involved. The painting was a woman pissing with a Mondrian tank top blouse on her , it was a painting that subsequently was reproduced in Penthouse Magazine twice.( I was paid $500 each time.) Anyway Jimmy wanted this painting him being a lover of Mondrian as am I am and a pee fetishist ( though I was reading Michel Foucault at the time and Jimmy was not). So here in this blog is the photo I screen grabbed from the video of my small oil painting which was on Hayward's wall in one of his guest rooms (sheds?) on his ranch in Moorpark CA. A painting which I still quite love, at the time I made several iterations of this motif. Some appear in Man Bag zines.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;Fourth paragraph - The final illustration to this blog is the first version of the pissing woman image on glass (an ordinary storm window) this painting was part of a three paneled work (an altarpiece) entitled <strong>The Chapel of Unsold Paintings<\/strong>&nbsp;This work was only exhibited once at the University of Minneasota - Katherine Nash gallery . This glass panel painting was sold in barter to a professional photographer who lives in St Paul. Jim Hayward tried to get me to see if the collector would sell it to him. The collector would not sell his painting (which his wife hates though I suspect she knows it's valuable? ). Another panel of the three is in the permanent collection of the Walker Art Center. The idea of the Chapel of Unsold paintings was the central premise of an unsuccessful application to the Guggenheim Foundation. Simply put I wanted to do an exhibition of my unsold inventory which has a dark resonance a lot of monsters in those giant paintings in storage and in those boxes and dozens of note books. But I wanted the inference of a Chapel as if the art had a special spiritual life about it because of religious themes and iconic images and of course sexual taboos and violent images of mayhem and such, indeed the distressful nature of much of my inventory contrbuted mightily to it's remaining unsold. The woman urinating was supposed to be Mlle Brancusci the lover of the sculptor whom Duchamp acted as an art dealer for ( the Philadelphia Museum has a large collection of Brancusci's sculptures that I am nearly certain were sold to Mr Arensburg by his good friend Mssr Duchamp (for a small fee in a Amerika)). The storm window I painted on was for Marcel Duchamp and for the idea that Mssr D. was a lady killer.As scholarship has advanced in studies of Mssr.

As a bi-polar my sexuality was as intense as any one's but my troubles in relationships seemed to be much worse, as if the handicap was this sort of optimism run amuck followed by dangerous falls into the abyss of abandonment. So I had lots of stories to tell that seemed to speak to men's issues about sexual failure or is it the desire being the source of one's decline? Same goes for Stu his physical handicap made his life much different than most men, his feelings and desires similar but his ability to find fulfilment limited by his body's limitations. His art was his advantage and his best weapon for expressing his angst about being in a world where difference was always a limitation.

Stu Mead recreated the Artpolice Comics as a edgy younger sex obsessed zine what it had been in the early years when McDonnell's cartoon was censored by the art school. Artpolice had a great deal of talent but it was elsewhere mostly Ed and Chris in Brooklyn and other contributors were scattered throughout the USA. Mead and I found a perfect balance in the Man Bag zine. Stu Mead's pictures were so dark that they almost seemed like perverted fairy tales. I remember in reviews I was always described as main stream pornographic &nbsp;as in normal perversions whilst Stu Mead had driven his art into the sexual barnyard manure! A favorite image was young girls daughters crapping on the fresh grave &nbsp;of the deceased father (Stu Mead's name on tombstone!) This gives you an idea of the territory he inhabits picture wise. I suppose I gave him some curious permission to delve deeper into his more perverse ideas about pictures. The period of this project was very clearly a high and low point for both of us, as Man Bag had caught on enough to give us a start beyond the older Artpolice Journals which were fading as the internet was rising.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;My friend Mike Kelley was interested in the Man Bag (he called it the child of the ArtpoliceComics) he thought we had captured something from the old men's magazines (one handers) like Click and Peek etc. Mike felt we were putting dirty back into pornography which had become captive of porn cartels and fancy productions. Our return to back and white digest sized zines was a return to a pocket sized format (easy to conceal in coat pocket). Support for the project was strong Robert Crumb was a fan of Stu Mead's drawings. We were connecting with a broad spectrum of creative people. &nbsp;(curators too Toni Stoos and Philippe Vergne were fans)The Artpolice was just too arty for the world writ more political sex though has a universal appeal and seductiveness. Sick sex seemed all sex at times that it was an ocean people swam in but didn't bring bad pictures paintings as much as in the past. Indeed Freud seemed to be about sexual issues taboos and fetishes and Lacan well he was all sex all the time, Foucault as well obsession was the starting point.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;Stu Mead has very unusual skills for drawing and painting. His instincts are very oriented to the figure and the immediate enviroment of the figure. Also the portraits we both do are woven into this story. My portraits were really begun in the mid-1980's and Stu's portraits start in the early 1990's but mostly in Berlin. Mead and I are both sort of outsider artists even though we have had more main stream elements to our art careers. But we both have worked in the sex area on and off all through our lives. Other factors are useful I have had problems with bi-polar disorder since 1974 requiring hospitalization and long regimes of medications . I have been in remission since the late 1980's when I had two relapses. I was stabilized with Lithium . Now the intensity of my art often reflects the extreme states of affairs in my brain chemistry my bi-polar brain altered by stress and dread. But art has given me an outlet for my feelings frustration etc. Stu Mead's issues are more physical with a large component of pyschology but the results we get are similar a sense of being different even different desires and realities.

Stu Mead recreated the Artpolice Comics as a edgy younger sex obsessed zine what it had been in the early years when McDonnell's cartoon was censored by the art school. Artpolice had a great deal of talent but it was elsewhere mostly Ed and Chris in Brooklyn and other contributors were scattered throughout the USA. Mead and I found a perfect balance in the Man Bag zine. Stu Mead's pictures were so dark that they almost seemed like perverted fairy tales. I remember in reviews I was always described as main stream pornographic &nbsp;as in normal perversions whilst Stu Mead had driven his art into the sexual barnyard manure! A favorite image was young girls daughters crapping on the fresh grave &nbsp;of the deceased father (Stu Mead's name on tombstone!) This gives you an idea of the territory he inhabits picture wise. I suppose I gave him some curious permission to delve deeper into his more perverse ideas about pictures. The period of this project was very clearly a high and low point for both of us, as Man Bag had caught on enough to give us a start beyond the older Artpolice Journals which were fading as the internet was rising.&nbsp;<\/p><p>&nbsp;My friend Mike Kelley was interested in the Man Bag (he called it the child of the ArtpoliceComics) he thought we had captured something from the old men's magazines (one handers) like Click and Peek etc. Mike felt we were putting dirty back into pornography which had become captive of porn cartels and fancy productions. Our return to back and white digest sized zines was a return to a pocket sized format (easy to conceal in coat pocket). Support for the project was strong Robert Crumb was a fan of Stu Mead's drawings. We were connecting with a broad spectrum of creative people. &nbsp;(curators too Toni Stoos and Philippe Vergne were fans)The Artpolice was just too arty for the world writ more political sex though has a universal appeal and seductiveness. Sick sex seemed all sex at times that it was an ocean people swam in but didn't bring bad pictures paintings as much as in the past. Indeed Freud seemed to be about sexual issues taboos and fetishes and Lacan well he was all sex all the time, Foucault as well obsession was the starting point.&nbsp;<\/p><p>&nbsp;Stu Mead has very unusual skills for drawing and painting. His instincts are very oriented to the figure and the immediate enviroment of the figure. Also the portraits we both do are woven into this story. My portraits were really begun in the mid-1980's and Stu's portraits start in the early 1990's but mostly in Berlin. Mead and I are both sort of outsider artists even though we have had more main stream elements to our art careers. But we both have worked in the sex area on and off all through our lives. Other factors are useful I have had problems with bi-polar disorder since 1974 requiring hospitalization and long regimes of medications . I have been in remission since the late 1980's when I had two relapses. I was stabilized with Lithium . Now the intensity of my art often reflects the extreme states of affairs in my brain chemistry my bi-polar brain altered by stress and dread. But art has given me an outlet for my feelings frustration etc. Stu Mead's issues are more physical with a large component of pyschology but the results we get are similar a sense of being different even different desires and realities. It's as if we are how we are and we move on from there as if it's a given in the equation. We make no judgements about each other the partnership is more as artists than as beings. Our artistic enterprises are joined indeed the surrender of the auteur stigma allows us to be oher persons false identitities and claims abound.

The mood of creation s fragile as Yeats wrote but it is also deeply mortal painters don't paint after death though they may influence the living by example. For me Manet is still alive. Duchamp is alive in so many new works by others and new thoughts. The idea that influence is the &nbsp;immortality we seek, also drives the artist to make something that persists as thought as idea long after the life of the artist has passed.<\/p>\n<p>Now the stories of the pictures illustrating this blog.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp; 1. \"Mondrian's Snowshovel in The Villa of Mysteries\" 1984 -oil and canvas 66 X 72\" this painting was half of a pair of paintings made simultaneously under a sub-title of Bi-Polar Disorders exhibited at the Medium West Gallery in 1985. The idea was Piet Mondrian calling Marcel Duchamp to obtain a snowshovel (readymade 1915 a sculpture bought in a hardware store in New York City) Mondrian paints the snowshovel red yellow and blue his signature colors.It's a fiction of course but based on their art works and that they were both immigrant artists living in New York City at the same time. May I add two of my most favorite artists with an intellectual turn of mind and vision. The Villa of Mysteries is a very famous site in Pompei of &nbsp;mural paintings involving the Dionysiac mystery religion.Again these are some of my most favorite antique paintings. Hence the painting tries to depict the origins of my peculiar desire for the ancient and modern arts in combinations. The Mondrian's Snowshovel motif appears in many other works of this period, including a large collage in the collection of the Walker Art Center. The painting is in the Collection of Grinnell College in Iowa I've only seen it once since it was sold but I do think it can be very inspiring in many ways. For me it's a buoy in the deep waters of my art life that reminds that too far out is just the start of going deeper.<\/p>\n<p>2. \" A Map of My Pathetic Career on Panties\" 1996 acrylic on canvas 4 X 4' - Again the idea of too far out, so far that you need a map to find your way back. Again history personal history is an inspiration for this peculiar map painting. Some of it actual some of it fictional some of it perfected some of it ordinary. Like a scorecard in a baseball game the players here are institutions and individuals who at points in my life were locations actual and imaginary. I asked a poet once if poetry was fiction? She didn't really have a satisfactory answer. What I thought is that poetry becomes non-fiction in it's expression but all art is fictive it imitates life and our living life. This painting was about poetry about names. language ideas about words that inhabit art and the art world. Make no doubt about it I expected to be more a part of something than I was , for many reasons I lived outside the mainstream outside the marketplace on a frontier ( out West of the Mississippi), in a place where winter is the ocean we live in that winter over and over. The deep cold the deep darkness of nearly Canada our neighbor to the North, our frontier . So again the painting is a map of one's failings one's small successes one's humaness.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;3. The Swan - I found the Swan image on an Art Nouveau advertisement , on a can. I like it as a symbol of serenity of peace understanding the persistence of beauty in a violent chaotic world. Also it's so perfect in it's form readymade I've used it many times in paintings collages prints etc. I never tire of this image, I give it away I possess it .

When I was in California I first began writing in earnest as my family and friends were in Chicago later when I came to Minneapolis to teach I wrote friends in California and in New York City. At certain points specific correspondences dominated , for instance lately I write my friend and collaborator Stu Mead in Berlin at least once or twice most months but my other correspondents less often. In the distant past I wrote my old friend Steve in Viet Nam. And by email I've written many people particularly people in the arts like Kathy Halbreich&nbsp; or decades ago Walter Hopps.<\/p>\n<p>I've come to have my doubts about writing as I've grown old. Not that I don't think it can be effective as a means of communication but rather that the world has a shorter attention span the 140 characters allowed by Twitter a case in point. The world is much less patient with text than it once was. The comment the quip much more welcome than the essay or the 500 page novel , even films rarely exceed a 90 minute time frame, people are anxious to return to their electric devices see what has happened since last they looked. And looking is a key term the world is more visual and less about reading. This may explain why slogans often are more effective than reasoned arguements we just don't have the patience for a contemplative turn of mind. I often think that what seems like a long time now is really not such a thing it's something to do with our new media times, we don't have patience because we are so connected that patience seems like yesterday like a different time frame. Sure painting suffers as well as people don't understand what to do with a static object after a few moments of looking at it indeed one of the reasons installation art is so popular is it creates a sort of experience in space more like a film set than a painting. Installations invite a faster take, you walk bye you glance you get an impression and an experience is driven by one's movement by changing positions relative to the size of the work. This first became apparent when paintings and sculptures grew to quite enormous sizes often filling gallery walls and rooms. This experiential situation is more film like more like a period room or a fun house room. This movement towards an art that was a more complete experience began when I was a very young artist and continues today it's sort of the answer to the increasing desire for more wholistic art experiences. It's one of the reasons I prefer to have a hand in installs of my work, I feel an exhibition needs be a spectacle to be of interest and notice to the present day demands of an audiences increasingly in a hurry to get their thrills and insights. Life is shorter than it used to be one thinks and senses. Or the audiences are in a hurry to get back to their other desires , the news feed waits for no one.<\/p>\n<p>The letter is to you it need find some common ground as here in terms of visual art and writing about art. We are fickle beings yesterday's hero is todays object of ridicule. Many of the virtues have become nuisances , justice is farther off than it ever was. People say life isn't fair I say it capricious but a future will replace these times that perhaps will see things quite differently than we do. Marcel Duchamp felt that posterity was the ultimate arbiter of what is art and what is not art. And I agree having lived into this new century and this new technological reality it seems as if I have lived into my own posterity or at least it's beginning. And though I miss somethings I enjoy being able to see the shape of things to come even as my own world fades into the shade of time past when art and music opened up a world for many of we young hungry souls.<\/p>","raw":"<p>I've written many letters in my life.

And by email I've written many people particularly people in the arts like Kathy Halbreich&nbsp; or decades ago Walter Hopps.<\/p><p>I've come to have my doubts about writing as I've grown old. Not that I don't think it can be effective as a means of communication but rather that the world has a shorter attention span the 140 characters allowed by Twitter a case in point. The world is much less patient with text than it once was. The comment the quip much more welcome than the essay or the 500 page novel , even films rarely exceed a 90 minute time frame, people are anxious to return to their electric devices see what has happened since last they looked. And looking is a key term the world is more visual and less about reading. This may explain why slogans often are more effective than reasoned arguements we just don't have the patience for a contemplative turn of mind. I often think that what seems like a long time now is really not such a thing it's something to do with our new media times, we don't have patience because we are so connected that patience seems like yesterday like a different time frame. Sure painting suffers as well as people don't understand what to do with a static object after a few moments of looking at it indeed one of the reasons installation art is so popular is it creates a sort of experience in space more like a film set than a painting. Installations invite a faster take, you walk bye you glance you get an impression and an experience is driven by one's movement by changing positions relative to the size of the work. This first became apparent when paintings and sculptures grew to quite enormous sizes often filling gallery walls and rooms. This experiential situation is more film like more like a period room or a fun house room. This movement towards an art that was a more complete experience began when I was a very young artist and continues today it's sort of the answer to the increasing desire for more wholistic art experiences. It's one of the reasons I prefer to have a hand in installs of my work, I feel an exhibition needs be a spectacle to be of interest and notice to the present day demands of an audiences increasingly in a hurry to get their thrills and insights. Life is shorter than it used to be one thinks and senses. Or the audiences are in a hurry to get back to their other desires , the news feed waits for no one.<\/p><p>The letter is to you it need find some common ground as here in terms of visual art and writing about art. We are fickle beings yesterday's hero is todays object of ridicule. Many of the virtues have become nuisances , justice is farther off than it ever was. People say life isn't fair I say it capricious but a future will replace these times that perhaps will see things quite differently than we do. Marcel Duchamp felt that posterity was the ultimate arbiter of what is art and what is not art. And I agree having lived into this new century and this new technological reality it seems as if I have lived into my own posterity or at least it's beginning. And though I miss somethings I enjoy being able to see the shape of things to come even as my own world fades into the shade of time past when art and music opened up a world for many of we young hungry souls.<\/p>","class":"body","label":"body","is_multiple":false},"created":{"id":"created","content":"1467288543","raw":"1467306543","class":"created","label":"date","is_multiple":false},"field_photo_fid":{"id":"field_photo_fid","content":{"1":"sites\/default\/files\/photos\/12145612_1091647777526632_1432567314_n_0_0.jpg","2":"sites\/default\/files\/photos\/DSCN2132_0.JPG"},"raw":{"1":null,"2":null},"class":"field-photo-fid","label":"Photo","is_multiple":true},"nid":{"id":"nid","content":"997","raw":"997","class":"nid","label":"Nid","is_multiple":false},"path":{"id":"path","content":"\/blog\/blog-not-letter","raw":null,"class":"path","label":"path","is_multiple":false}},{"title":{"id":"title","content":"Different but Similar","raw":"Different but Similar","class":"title","label":"title","is_multiple":false},"body":{"id":"body","content":"<p>Some portraits old and new ,differenty and similar. end pic blog<\/p>\n<p>Pics in order - 1.David B &amp; Iman 2016, 2.Two Pete D.

My father was a very philosophical man though he only had a third grade education (the requirement for immigrants in the late 1930's), He lived a life much more tumultuous than I coming here in a rusty tub from Norway and finding his way to his mom's place in Chicago without any English. His mom had answered an advertisement in a newspaper in Norway of a widowed farmer in Minnesota looking for a wife. When the farmer died she sold the farm moved to Chicago and bought an old Victorian house on Humboldt Blvd. She then brought her youngest children over to start new lives in Chicago. My dad worked on the dredges cleaning the Chicago River and Lake Michigan shoreline to make way for ships coming in through the Great Lakes.&nbsp; Literally shittest job a person could do. When a friend got him in the painter's union it was as if he had won the sweepstakes .<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;During the war years he spent time working as a dock hand in Trinidad , he used to tell me those were the happiest days of his life.

I say we need more philosophers and more robot welders. Philosophy is not so difficult as people suppose. My father was a very philosophical man though he only had a third grade education (the requirement for immigrants in the late 1930's), He lived a life much more tumultuous than I coming here in a rusty tub from Norway and finding his way to his mom's place in Chicago without any English. His mom had answered an advertisement in a newspaper in Norway of a widowed farmer in Minnesota looking for a wife. When the farmer died she sold the farm moved to Chicago and bought an old Victorian house on Humboldt Blvd. She then brought her youngest children over to start new lives in Chicago. My dad worked on the dredges cleaning the Chicago River and Lake Michigan shoreline to make way for ships coming in through the Great Lakes.&nbsp; Literally shittest job a person could do.

Now in Venice (Biennale) next he'll be in Gondola with chimps. Ms Darsie Alexander alive and well seen recently in the pages of The NYTimes (with Barthomeow). IPop a big hit or at least very tasty entertainment with real art stars (like a wax museum of Pop Art). The Billy Apple's SuperMarket fruit section installation is a knock out worth the price of admission Billy is still alive (Bart said) he is a totally lost genius of Pop this piece is extraordinary as good as anything like it as good as Ben! Ben's window is in storage again, I think it needs a permanent install like Duchamp's final installation in Philly Museum of Art. The Ben window is a thing which deserves to be always up (Frankie opines).<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp; I felt a lot of nostalgia in the Barnes galleries during my visit to the International Pop exhibition. This was where the Walker grew from this 1960's material and what came of it ie. minimal conceptual installation art, Op art as well seems intimately connected to Pop. Martin Friedman acquired Pop works which are now nearly priceless. The Jasper Johns withe negative image color effect would sell for 100s of millions at auction.They could save the ship with that one and a few other items like those Brillo Boxes jeez those would be worth a handsome ransom. Year ago Peter Saul (not in International Pop {was in Hand Painted Pop forgot museum) my friend and bad example}said \" Don't get too interested in other artist's work and in rich people\". Peter was right and I have lived somewhat with these thoughts in mind. I'm not as obsessed with Saul's work as I was as a very young artist. It was a pure accident that I was in Saul's seminar at CCAC in 1968 save that it was the best criticisms I'd ever heard. Anyway Saul was part of Pop from the outside in, he was the wild punk ass pop art be made in Rome and elsewheres in the early 1960's in my mind is a key figure in the period not just his politics (leftist anarchist) but his color and form making, Saul's sick green pop is the anti-Pop the hangover style. An intoxicated realm of anything it takes to make a great painting. His inspiration was to find the personal in your art that which is only you, sounds simpler now but it was the cry to remain yourself remain outside the art circus. Saul was the unAndy even though he envied Andy Warhol's successes and made fun of him and his work. I thought it was his desire to be a hypocritical voice always on both sides of things artistic and political. Indeed hypocrisy maybe at the bottom why Pop Art was so perfect for a pop culture that loves it's poisons.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp; The edgy side of Pop was political it was a sort of blue collar style as silk screen was a cheap efficient image making stencil system. The situation in say 1965 between Warhol's ascent and Peter Saul's critique were both on my mind as an art student (staying in school a good student on scholarship dodging the Vietnam draft). Everyone is compromised at times, the artist between survival and a dream . Saul is 10 years older than me and he's wiser but he's also someone still in the big game who has a real tale to tell. The show of his paintings recently in New York (Venus show) paintings acquired from him by Allan Frumkin his friend and dealer I think made a deep impression on some friends I have who saw it. Peter is amazing an inspiration for old Pop artists everywhere!

Now in Venice (Biennale) next he'll be in Gondola with chimps. Ms Darsie Alexander alive and well seen recently in the pages of The NYTimes (with Barthomeow). IPop a big hit or at least very tasty entertainment with real art stars (like a wax museum of Pop Art). The Billy Apple's SuperMarket fruit section installation is a knock out worth the price of admission Billy is still alive (Bart said) he is a totally lost genius of Pop this piece is extraordinary as good as anything like it as good as Ben! Ben's window is in storage again, I think it needs a permanent install like Duchamp's final installation in Philly Museum of Art. The Ben window is a thing which deserves to be always up (Frankie opines).<\/p><p>&nbsp; I felt a lot of nostalgia in the Barnes galleries during my visit to the International Pop exhibition. This was where the Walker grew from this 1960's material and what came of it ie. minimal conceptual installation art, Op art as well seems intimately connected to Pop. Martin Friedman acquired Pop works which are now nearly priceless. The Jasper Johns withe negative image color effect would sell for 100s of millions at auction.They could save the ship with that one and a few other items like those Brillo Boxes jeez those would be worth a handsome ransom. Year ago Peter Saul (not in International Pop {was in Hand Painted Pop forgot museum) my friend and bad example}said \" Don't get too interested in other artist's work and in rich people\". Peter was right and I have lived somewhat with these thoughts in mind. I'm not as obsessed with Saul's work as I was as a very young artist. It was a pure accident that I was in Saul's seminar at CCAC in 1968 save that it was the best criticisms I'd ever heard. Anyway Saul was part of Pop from the outside in, he was the wild punk ass pop art be made in Rome and elsewheres in the early 1960's in my mind is a key figure in the period not just his politics (leftist anarchist) but his color and form making, Saul's sick green pop is the anti-Pop the hangover style. An intoxicated realm of anything it takes to make a great painting. His inspiration was to find the personal in your art that which is only you, sounds simpler now but it was the cry to remain yourself remain outside the art circus. Saul was the unAndy even though he envied Andy Warhol's successes and made fun of him and his work. I thought it was his desire to be a hypocritical voice always on both sides of things artistic and political. Indeed hypocrisy maybe at the bottom why Pop Art was so perfect for a pop culture that loves it's poisons.<\/p><p>&nbsp; The edgy side of Pop was political it was a sort of blue collar style as silk screen was a cheap efficient image making stencil system. The situation in say 1965 between Warhol's ascent and Peter Saul's critique were both on my mind as an art student (staying in school a good student on scholarship dodging the Vietnam draft). Everyone is compromised at times, the artist between survival and a dream . Saul is 10 years older than me and he's wiser but he's also someone still in the big game who has a real tale to tell. The show of his paintings recently in New York (Venus show) paintings acquired from him by Allan Frumkin his friend and dealer I think made a deep impression on some friends I have who saw it. Peter is amazing an inspiration for old Pop artists everywhere!

I think my work has always been about art as gardens as little respites from the pain and the meaningless that often surrounds us. My art is an alternative view I know and it is complex but at base I've tried to find a means to engage the viewer in a way that opens the doors of perception rather than creates some deep meaning or insight indeed as Marcel Duchamp said the viewer completes the art work by seeing it .<\/p><p>jpg illustrations - Jpgs of painted cds 2.

The thing is exhibiting these portraits in clusters requires having lots of them to choose from and in museums you can retrieve the ones that sell to show a deeper view of the ongoing project. I'm guessing I've painted more than 200 of these things. The effect of walls covered with these portraits can be pretty engaging for the viewers. So the variety and diversity contributes to the over all effect of these installations<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;But like anything we do at some point one looks for a new way to do things. Not to mention just looking for ways to freshen up a long continuing project. Recently my spouse Pamela joined me in working from the models that is we work in tandem from the same sitter. These double portraits have been exhibited several times in different settings and they have added some new aspects to the installations and exhibits . The differences play out between our approaches and something happens in people seeing these two views of the same sitter. It's partly a different emphasis and different aims. Pamela gets better likenesses most times using photos of the sitters to refine her portraits whilst I don't usually get much of a likeness I look for a picture and for certain dynamics inherent in the pose, my color is more vivid and used more to fracture the picture. That is to create a thing in itself rather than mimesis I aim for something more alarming and original. Often my portraits seem a bit like monsters. But that maybe why the two artist's works together create such a satisfying result several clients have purchased both of their portraits which creates this odd dimension to these pieces as works unto themselves by two artists. It's an experiment about the binary nature of difference and it has created some very unusual pairs of portraits. <\/p>","raw":"<p>In the mid 1980's when I started my portraits I thought I might make some money selling them.

The thing is exhibiting these portraits in clusters requires having lots of them to choose from and in museums you can retrieve the ones that sell to show a deeper view of the ongoing project. I'm guessing I've painted more than 200 of these things. The effect of walls covered with these portraits can be pretty engaging for the viewers. So the variety and diversity contributes to the over all effect of these installations<\/p><p>&nbsp;But like anything we do at some point one looks for a new way to do things. Not to mention just looking for ways to freshen up a long continuing project. Recently my spouse Pamela joined me in working from the models that is we work in tandem from the same sitter. These double portraits have been exhibited several times in different settings and they have added some new aspects to the installations and exhibits . The differences play out between our approaches and something happens in people seeing these two views of the same sitter. It's partly a different emphasis and different aims. Pamela gets better likenesses most times using photos of the sitters to refine her portraits whilst I don't usually get much of a likeness I look for a picture and for certain dynamics inherent in the pose, my color is more vivid and used more to fracture the picture. That is to create a thing in itself rather than mimesis I aim for something more alarming and original. Often my portraits seem a bit like monsters. But that maybe why the two artist's works together create such a satisfying result several clients have purchased both of their portraits which creates this odd dimension to these pieces as works unto themselves by two artists. It's an experiment about the binary nature of difference and it has created some very unusual pairs of portraits. <\/p>","class":"body","label":"body","is_multiple":false},"created":{"id":"created","content":"1412685823","raw":"1412703823","class":"created","label":"date","is_multiple":false},"field_photo_fid":{"id":"field_photo_fid","content":{"1":"sites\/default\/files\/photos\/47736_10100421274175265_105592772_n.jpg","2":"sites\/default\/files\/photos\/DSCN1848_0.JPG","3":"sites\/default\/files\/photos\/6779404373_8a3c194f9d_b.jpg","4":"sites\/default\/files\/photos\/166546_10151188579023761_775713640_n_0.jpg"},"raw":{"1":null,"2":null,"3":null,"4":null},"class":"field-photo-fid","label":"Photo","is_multiple":true},"nid":{"id":"nid","content":"955","raw":"955","class":"nid","label":"Nid","is_multiple":false},"path":{"id":"path","content":"\/blog\/portraits-1985-2014","raw":null,"class":"path","label":"path","is_multiple":false}},{"title":{"id":"title","content":"This Could Be My Last Blog","raw":"This Could Be My Last Blog","class":"title","label":"title","is_multiple":false},"body":{"id":"body","content":"<p>I have a new painting nearly done (I'm supposing) thinking about a photo with tripod I have no sun right now crucial to my color&nbsp; even as photographs.

Which turned out to be true. I've been thinking about the big acquisition of the huge Sigmar Polke painting in 1994, Autumn and her Daughters . I wrote a short piece about it in Artpaper and Ms Halbreich dug it. Hence I had a friend at the Walker. Same sort of thing happened with a curator at Walker about the Hannah Hoch show (Peter Boswell). The short piece in the TC Reader was really a hacket job by the editor but the Walker loved it, they gave me a pass to the Hoch opening which was quite an affair. As I approached Hannah Hoch's montages I could smell the parfum of the last person who looked closely, different perfumes at different pictures. Pretty fucking elegant!&nbsp; It took quite a number of patrons of the Walker to pay for the Polke. Museums don't tell you what things cost but damn giantpaintings by famous European artists&nbsp; cost big cash. Which only adds to the mystery of whose this Sigmar Polke guy anyway? I knew Polke a bit from magazines and a few pieces here and there. I thought the acquisition was stunning partly the big money but also that it had the imprint of ambition for the institution we (WAC) will stay in the big art game. This was clear with the huge Bruce Nauman show that Halbreich did that literary filled the Barnes tower with his work. Some very precious old works along with Clown Torture and his strange carousels of taxidermy models (oi still makes me cringe) I'm not from Minnesota. Kthy was big on Nauman and big on Nauman.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I met Kathy when Elizabeth Armstrong (curator - 1994-&nbsp; @ walkerart.org) was doing the Duchamp's Leg. We talked a bit about The Anti-Sculpture League and how people love sculpture ya da ya da.. I never liked the sculpture garden even the one at MoMA.

Which turned out to be true. I've been thinking about the big acquisition of the huge Sigmar Polke painting in 1994, Autumn and her Daughters . I wrote a short piece about it in Artpaper and Ms Halbreich dug it. Hence I had a friend at the Walker. Same sort of thing happened with a curator at Walker about the Hannah Hoch show (Peter Boswell). The short piece in the TC Reader was really a hacket job by the editor but the Walker loved it, they gave me a pass to the Hoch opening which was quite an affair. As I approached Hannah Hoch's montages I could smell the parfum of the last person who looked closely, different perfumes at different pictures. Pretty fucking elegant!&nbsp; It took quite a number of patrons of the Walker to pay for the Polke. Museums don't tell you what things cost but damn giantpaintings by famous European artists&nbsp; cost big cash. Which only adds to the mystery of whose this Sigmar Polke guy anyway? I knew Polke a bit from magazines and a few pieces here and there. I thought the acquisition was stunning partly the big money but also that it had the imprint of ambition for the institution we (WAC) will stay in the big art game. This was clear with the huge Bruce Nauman show that Halbreich did that literary filled the Barnes tower with his work. Some very precious old works along with Clown Torture and his strange carousels of taxidermy models (oi still makes me cringe) I'm not from Minnesota. Kthy was big on Nauman and big on Nauman.<\/p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I met Kathy when Elizabeth Armstrong (curator - 1994-&nbsp; @ walkerart.org) was doing the Duchamp's Leg. We talked a bit about The Anti-Sculpture League and how people love sculpture ya da ya da.. I never liked the sculpture garden even the one at MoMA.

I had some good ideas which perished in a couple of blog crashes, now Sam says the blog is attached to a different type of server that allows one blog site to crash without taking all the other blogs on that server with it. \/\/ So I was writing about a large painting that I made in 1970 entering the collections at the Walker Art Center just as I pushed save the text vanished into the electronic abyss. But writing about this acquisition a third time requires some creative thinking lest I stray unto the path well trodden of cliches. The painting was made under the influence of the artist Peter Saul who I met in Oakland California in 1968. I was finishing my MFA at CCAC ( now CCA ) (we live amidst the acronyms) so Peter offered a seminar basically a weekly critique at the art school. What I learned from Peter directly and indirectly was you just had to be great, great was the normal case for an srtist, at least if you were reaching for something higher than a salary. Though Peter wouldn't say it that way, he has a very colorful way of speaking and especially about art. So this 40 year old painting which Peter liked very much ( I think he was flattered to have had such an impact on my art work) but in some ways it was a path not taken. Though I toiled in the vineyard for years I think in the end that had more to do with shaking off Peter's influence I needed to care less what he thought in order to proceed. It's nice having the webmaster in the next room.<\/p>\n<p>The painting is titled<strong> In The Time Being<\/strong> it's 7 X 10 feet painted in 1970 and finished in 1971. Several other related paintings and works on paper were made and exhibited with this huge canvas at the Minneapolis Institute of Arts in May of 1971. The gallery on&nbsp;North side of the building had beautiful clear North light, the colors in the paintings were quite radiant and even more so on sunny days The reception for the painting was good even the review was positive albeit warning people that the color was very psychedelic and<br \/>&nbsp;the images were cartoon like (Like Zap comics). \/\/\/ The painting was in the collection of Leo Kuelbs who lives in Brooklyn NY he gave it to the Walker and that was a very nice gesture. The painting was on the cover of the Blue Hippos LP entitled 40 40 in 1987 I think. It was published by Twin Tone records.

I had some good ideas which perished in a couple of blog crashes, now Sam says the blog is attached to a different type of server that allows one blog site to crash without taking all the other blogs on that server with it. \/\/ So I was writing about a large painting that I made in 1970 entering the collections at the Walker Art Center just as I pushed save the text vanished into the electronic abyss. But writing about this acquisition a third time requires some creative thinking lest I stray unto the path well trodden of cliches. The painting was made under the influence of the artist Peter Saul who I met in Oakland California in 1968. I was finishing my MFA at CCAC ( now CCA ) (we live amidst the acronyms) so Peter offered a seminar basically a weekly critique at the art school. What I learned from Peter directly and indirectly was you just had to be great, great was the normal case for an srtist, at least if you were reaching for something higher than a salary. Though Peter wouldn't say it that way, he has a very colorful way of speaking and especially about art. So this 40 year old painting which Peter liked very much ( I think he was flattered to have had such an impact on my art work) but in some ways it was a path not taken. Though I toiled in the vineyard for years I think in the end that had more to do with shaking off Peter's influence I needed to care less what he thought in order to proceed. It's nice having the webmaster in the next room.<\/p><p>The painting is titled<strong> In The Time Being<\/strong> it's 7 X 10 feet painted in 1970 and finished in 1971. Several other related paintings and works on paper were made and exhibited with this huge canvas at the Minneapolis Institute of Arts in May of 1971. The gallery on&nbsp;North side of the building had beautiful clear North light, the colors in the paintings were quite radiant and even more so on sunny days The reception for the painting was good even the review was positive albeit warning people that the color was very psychedelic and<br \/>&nbsp;the images were cartoon like (Like Zap comics). \/\/\/ The painting was in the collection of Leo Kuelbs who lives in Brooklyn NY he gave it to the Walker and that was a very nice gesture. The painting was on the cover of the Blue Hippos LP entitled 40 40 in 1987 I think. It was published by Twin Tone records.

Dick Tracy always got his man and his very silhouette struck fear in the criminals he pursued in serial fashion. On Sundays Tracy was the featured comic the first one at the top of the comics section in those lurid colors freshly printed the night before and nothing came close to the intensity of the crime stories that were told in those pages. Chester Gould the cartoonist was an avid conservative , a hunter and a friend to all reactionaries everywhere. Tracy started years before I came upon it, Chicago was quite a crime story itself everybody seemed to be involved in some illegal activity. The headlines in the tabloid Chicago Sun-Times were intense always murders especially gangland type slayings or whatever lurid photos would attract the most readers. Everyday the Sun-Times would give you the impression that horrible crimes were taking place all around you (not unlike The Daily-News tabloid in New York City). My Dad ate these stories up everyday it gave you a very curious and anxious perception of your home town. And Dick Tracy was the graphic version of those headlines, it was also this sense of crime being the big issue the big story. And the police could barely keep up with the mayhem. Tracy of course was always one step ahead of the crooks but it could take him weeks and weeks to catch Pruneface or the Mole or any of the vermin he was after, Tracy was very deductive in process like Sherlock Holmes but in a modern post war America. I would copy his angular face with a pencil or trace a whole comic to experience the style, a style that changed very slowly over many years. Later when I used the image I always tried to make it my version of Tracy especially the color. The politics I put to one side, the law and order thing the horse that Nixon rode in on was always on my mind. Being a straight arrow was always something&nbsp; on your mind , Chicago was so full of cops! Indeed in the 1960's it seemed you couldn't do anything without the sense that cops were around the corner. In Dick Tracy the detectives were the smart cops and the regular uniformed cops were never the story they were more decorative. Tracy figured stuff out not the policemen. They worked for Tracy he was the main dude, he was the story. And he was a straight arrow even his nose was straight and his hat was always cocked on his head at a rakish angle so you knew it was him a signature yellow fedora. For me working with his image always makes me remember growing up in Chicago. I knew the artist worked in a studio in the Tribune Tower on Michigan Ave, on the Chicago River. Indeed as a youngster my idea of a real artist was Chester Gould. The sort of artist who make paintings seemed from another century. Who wants to paint flowers when you can tell stories about criminals like Flat Top and The Brow? I was lucky enough to be born into the golden age of comics and my sense of what was contemporary art was these Sunday Comic Sections of which 4 Chicago newspapers each ran sections on week ends. And it was most likely why I went into the arts why I drew pictures why I found such pleasure in color and characature. Later my fascination with the detective story I think led me in a philosophical direction intellectually. Because life is a bit like a mystery story and the artist has different ways to investigate the narratives. Indeed I came to feel that the artist was a detective of sorts, the curiosity of the artist about the world in all it's layed complexities makes itself more clear in the hands of a visual artist. A picture can tell you a lot, my studies of art history were my study of history minus all the language. Reading Raymond Chandler or seeing films based on his detective novels made Philip Marlowe his detective one of my favorite philosophers.

Elizabeth Armstrong was the principal curator then she was working on The Duchamp's Leg exhibition. It was Elizabeth who first called me a Duchamp expert to Kathy it was charming if a bit inaccurate, seeing as I'm a fan not an academic. I wore some Yves Ste. Laurent Opium parfum which maybe smelled nice but gave an odd signal. But you should smell nice, then again maybe they thought the other woman was wearing said scent.?&nbsp; This was 1993-4 or later, I can't remember names or times without concentrating. That's why my blogs often look back as I want to have some sketchie reckoning of my wanderings. As I wrote I quite enjoy Kathy's ideas her point of view is very precise, I think she holds many opinions . She loves art and she is very discerning and this discernment is the key help she provides those of us more lost in the wilderness of contemporary art and kultur.

Darsi is hard to figure ( she's more radical than most curators I've known), but I think the notes have some issues , less public work and less to show unless you photograph every page and make a program to show it (this was supposed to happen visavis the Poison &amp;&nbsp;Candy show). I think the museum need audiences and money in equal measure. Kathy's reign was before the financial meltdown but it makes all institutions more fragile moneywise.

The review in the Trib was dismissive but the show was fabulous even after the cops left and the dancing proceeded. Fritz Wolfmeyer our man in Chicago for the show had fallen for the gallery girl so his prep work was unfinished. Hudson{&nbsp;later ran Feature in NYC} ran the performance space that was on the other side of the wall at Randolph Street Gallery, he was a peach and remains a good friend of the project (most especially Man Bag subsidiary). The late great Eric Burmeister's giant portrait of <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Brooke Shields&nbsp;<\/span>&nbsp; was the hit of the show and Janet Groenert's paper wedding dress very close in popularity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p><p>&nbsp;So I was going to paint a picture of my first meeting with Ms. Kathy Halbreich when something went amiss with the jpg I posted of her(previous blogs).&nbsp; Anyway, this meeting took place in the Walker Art Center offices in the Barnes building, I'd only been in there once before years ago. Elizabeth Armstrong was the principal curator then she was working on The Duchamp's Leg exhibition. It was Elizabeth who first called me a Duchamp expert to Kathy it was charming if a bit inaccurate, seeing as I'm a fan not an academic. I wore some Yves Ste. Laurent Opium parfum which maybe smelled nice but gave an odd signal. But you should smell nice, then again maybe they thought the other woman was wearing said scent.?&nbsp; This was 1993-4 or later, I can't remember names or times without concentrating. That's why my blogs often look back as I want to have some sketchie reckoning of my wanderings. As I wrote I quite enjoy Kathy's ideas her point of view is very precise, I think she holds many opinions . She loves art and she is very discerning and this discernment is the key help she provides those of us more lost in the wilderness of contemporary art and kultur. She's brilliant but she's also oh so human.

These cultural and social dispersals create new homelands as the Jews did a hundred years ago creating a new home on the Lower East Side of Manhattan.

And anything that makes the model focus is good and the conversations that ensue also bring the sitter into a more thoughtful mood which appears in their gaze. The painting is beautiful and seductive. It's exotic sure but it's also right here in this room in Minneapolis.

The Yo Hoy Boy I made in many permutations in silkscreens and paintings and even in the Artpolicecomics.

Given the epidemic scale of depression in the world these days one supposes that you are either depressed or have people in your life who struggle with depression. My father treated his depression with alcohol long before anti-depressants or&nbsp; working people seeing psychiatrists. The most vivid symptom of his depression was anger. And that anger reeked havoc on my mother's body and soul. Of course I was a little kid I didn't know what was going on save that this anger dominated my childhood. It was like the wallpaper always there but hardly noticed until of course the wallpaper was on fire and my mother and I were on fire. My sister and I would take my mom to the state hospital when she had her spells ( her schizophrenia was treated with electro-shock therapy and soon she'd be home) , my father claimed the shock treatments were the only way mom could get well. As time passed her condition never improved nor did my father's behavior. They seperated when I was a teen for a long while I never saw my mom though once after almost a year I saw her outside the window of a bus I was in she didn't see me. My dad arranged for my sister and I to eat at a greasy spoon near where we lived, for more than a year I ate nothing but hamburgers and fries. I wasn't depressed but I wasn't happy either, my mom had always been my best support for my artistic dreams and I missed her steady encouragement. My father was not encouraging indeed he worried I would pursue my artist dream into poverty and woe.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp; My father was a simple hard working union painter. He was born in Western Norway and he began working as a child in the sardine factories in Stavanger. Children's small fingers were perfect for putting the slippery little fish into cans for the folks who could afford the them. My father came to Amerika after his mom moved to Chicago and bought an old Victorian rooming house near Humboldt Park in the Scandinavian enclave where immigrants felt comfotable speaking their native tongue. Grandma had answered an advt. in a Swedish newspaper looking for a Norwegian woman to marry a widower in Minnesota when he kicked grandma sold the farm and began bringing the younger children she had left behind to Chicago. Of course it was no picnic! My dad worked the dredges that were scooping up a century of muck and crap under the lake near the shore and in the entrance to the Chicago River. It was literally the shittest job one could have. This is around the time I was born (1944) and dredgeworker was the occupation listed for my dad on the birth certificate. I was an Amerikan my father was naturalised Amerikan having attained 3rd grade reading and math skills in classes for immigrants. Depression in my experience seems always related to work, jobs and the unfairness of selling our time to the &quot;the man&quot;.&nbsp; <\/p>\n<p>&nbsp; My mother was born in the upper penisula of Michigan in a Finnish enclave north of Hancock\/Houghton area. Her dad was a miner as were her brothers. They lived on a small farm with a small herd of dairy cows. Six children and when the mom died my mom was stuck being the mother to her younger brothers whilst the older sisters went off to high school. Eventually my mom moved to Chicago where her sisters were living, the story of how she hooked up with my father I don't know but he had some charm and a job! Also eligible men were in short supply during the war years. My mom's dad didn't like my dad old Finns are not friendly towards much of anything that ain't Finn. The story I heard was my mom had a post-partum psychosis. She ran after her husband to Elgin IL.&nbsp; with baby Franky in her arms in a state of unhingedness. How working people with little education dealt with madness was rather harsh. Over the years the beatings took a toll, by her mid 40's my mom was showing symptoms of Parkinson's Disease and by her early 50's the disease killed her. But she had managed to create an enormous amount of love in her life. More than anyone she created me an artist. And I remember her vividly 35 years later. My youngest son Max told me that when someone dies that you love they live in your heart and that is the case with my mother. She was not perfect but she made the most of what she had. And she didn't have much but she gave her love as if she would never run out of it. We learn by example. And my father's hard ass view of life also contributed to my survival and my depressions. <\/p>","raw":"<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; How I escaped an artless world. Of course no one escapes this artless world completely myself included.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; 1st jpg\/pic pony saved from destructive impulse.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;2nd&nbsp; Portrait of Kristen 1999&nbsp; through frame glass.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I remember a David Bowie song that had a lyric about learning to live with somebody else's depression. Given the epidemic scale of depression in the world these days one supposes that you are either depressed or have people in your life who struggle with depression. My father treated his depression with alcohol long before anti-depressants or&nbsp; working people seeing psychiatrists. The most vivid symptom of his depression was anger. And that anger reeked havoc on my mother's body and soul. Of course I was a little kid I didn't know what was going on save that this anger dominated my childhood. It was like the wallpaper always there but hardly noticed until of course the wallpaper was on fire and my mother and I were on fire. My sister and I would take my mom to the state hospital when she had her spells ( her schizophrenia was treated with electro-shock therapy and soon she'd be home) , my father claimed the shock treatments were the only way mom could get well. As time passed her condition never improved nor did my father's behavior. They seperated when I was a teen for a long while I never saw my mom though once after almost a year I saw her outside the window of a bus I was in she didn't see me. My dad arranged for my sister and I to eat at a greasy spoon near where we lived, for more than a year I ate nothing but hamburgers and fries. I wasn't depressed but I wasn't happy either, my mom had always been my best support for my artistic dreams and I missed her steady encouragement. My father was not encouraging indeed he worried I would pursue my artist dream into poverty and woe.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; My father was a simple hard working union painter. He was born in Western Norway and he began working as a child in the sardine factories in Stavanger. Children's small fingers were perfect for putting the slippery little fish into cans for the folks who could afford the them. My father came to Amerika after his mom moved to Chicago and bought an old Victorian rooming house near Humboldt Park in the Scandinavian enclave where immigrants felt comfotable speaking their native tongue. Grandma had answered an advt. in a Swedish newspaper looking for a Norwegian woman to marry a widower in Minnesota when he kicked grandma sold the farm and began bringing the younger children she had left behind to Chicago. Of course it was no picnic! My dad worked the dredges that were scooping up a century of muck and crap under the lake near the shore and in the entrance to the Chicago River. It was literally the shittest job one could have. This is around the time I was born (1944) and dredgeworker was the occupation listed for my dad on the birth certificate. I was an Amerikan my father was naturalised Amerikan having attained 3rd grade reading and math skills in classes for immigrants. Depression in my experience seems always related to work, jobs and the unfairness of selling our time to the &quot;the man&quot;.&nbsp; <\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; My mother was born in the upper penisula of Michigan in a Finnish enclave north of Hancock\/Houghton area. Her dad was a miner as were her brothers. They lived on a small farm with a small herd of dairy cows. Six children and when the mom died my mom was stuck being the mother to her younger brothers whilst the older sisters went off to high school. Eventually my mom moved to Chicago where her sisters were living, the story of how she hooked up with my father I don't know but he had some charm and a job! Also eligible men were in short supply during the war years. My mom's dad didn't like my dad old Finns are not friendly towards much of anything that ain't Finn. The story I heard was my mom had a post-partum psychosis. She ran after her husband to Elgin IL.&nbsp; with baby Franky in her arms in a state of unhingedness.

He would often show me and my sister his latest bridge or steeple that he had painted. He was anxious to show me some artworks that he found completely puzzling and suspected them of being hoaxes. One painting a rather huge vertical canvas looked like nothing so much as a dropcloth covered with a lot of thinned orange paint. Later I understood this painting to be the work of Mark Rothko. It was a laugh to my dad how such a thing could be celebrated in this antique house of art. <\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;Years later my Dad and I made a trip to the Art Institute to see a Marcel Duchamp retrospective . I recall my father's laughter when he saw R'Mutt the urinal Duchamp had presented as art to a jury for the 1st Armony Show (it was rejected and Alfred Stieglitz took the immortal photograph of the piece that we all know from art history classes.). I was happy my dad reacted and not surprised by his laughing indeed much modern art had been greeted with laughter and derision.&nbsp; Laughing seems better as a response to art than the sort quiet that greets so much historical art, the sort pious whispering&nbsp; and general sense that a gallery is not unlike a library.&nbsp; <em><strong>( one moment please we are having technical problems)<\/strong><\/em>&nbsp; That trip to see Duchamp's work and another I made to Philadephia to see the Large Glass&nbsp; and the secret tableaux ) really were exciting and though I can't precisely say how I found a distinct relationship between the Sephirotic Tree of Hebrew Mysticism and Marcel Duchamp's Large Glass (&nbsp;The so called Brides &amp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bachcelors ).

The administration of Dwight Eisenhower was fraught with passive aggressive realities. On the surface things never seemed better Mickey Mouse,Tupperware and biblical epics starting Charlton Heston teaching us bible stories transmogrified by so-called middle amerikan values. My dad was a commercial \/ industrial painter and I recall my first visit to the Art Institute of Chicago occurred when&nbsp; he was painting the vast galleries there . He would often show me and my sister his latest bridge or steeple that he had painted. He was anxious to show me some artworks that he found completely puzzling and suspected them of being hoaxes. One painting a rather huge vertical canvas looked like nothing so much as a dropcloth covered with a lot of thinned orange paint. Later I understood this painting to be the work of Mark Rothko. It was a laugh to my dad how such a thing could be celebrated in this antique house of art. <\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;Years later my Dad and I made a trip to the Art Institute to see a Marcel Duchamp retrospective . I recall my father's laughter when he saw R'Mutt the urinal Duchamp had presented as art to a jury for the 1st Armony Show (it was rejected and Alfred Stieglitz took the immortal photograph of the piece that we all know from art history classes.). I was happy my dad reacted and not surprised by his laughing indeed much modern art had been greeted with laughter and derision.&nbsp; Laughing seems better as a response to art than the sort quiet that greets so much historical art, the sort pious whispering&nbsp; and general sense that a gallery is not unlike a library.&nbsp; <em><strong>( one moment please we are having technical problems)<\/strong><\/em>&nbsp; That trip to see Duchamp's work and another I made to Philadephia to see the Large Glass&nbsp; and the secret tableaux ) really were exciting and though I can't precisely say how I found a distinct relationship between the Sephirotic Tree of Hebrew Mysticism and Marcel Duchamp's Large Glass (&nbsp;The so called Brides &amp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bachcelors ). Prof Jack Burnham wrote 3 essays in 1974 about Duchamp and the mystical traditions the Kabbalah and I shall always be in his debt for his pointing the way towards an alternative view of Marcel Duchamp.<\/p>\r\n<p>New Paragraph - One writer said my art up at the Walker Art Center was almost made like <strong>ALMOST&nbsp;CRAZY <\/strong>&nbsp; that sticks in my mind almost crazy. It is true somethings were when I was mad, technically. I destroyed things, I was in the grips of a huge delusion. But now I discovered I was partly correct, at least art-wise. It's Duchamp by a nose over Picasso and Pollock isn't in this horse race, Pollock is Atomic Super Optical Re-Mix.

It's painted in oils on a storm window an acquaintence of mine traded for it several years back. The work dates from the mid 1980's when I began a long spell of sexual imaging. I was in mid-divorce from my 2nd wife and pissed as much at myself as at her. She was 14 years younger than me and at times it seemed like much more that that time and wisdom wise. The break-up was sort of inevitable given our differences and our different desires. But I was soon packing up at the art school after 17 years of low wages and less than no support from the institution. It was kind of an overdose of art school after spending almost 6 years as a student and having been in an art program in high school I'd been in art school for way too long. So though I didn't agree with the grounds for my non-renewal I didn't call a lawyer I just figured my run was over. After my severence ran out and my unemployment I began living off my art work as best I could.You make more sales when you have too than when you are on the art teacher dole. The first big sale was the Shinder family buying a big painting for the Minneapolis Institute of Arts in 1990-1. Evan Maurer picked the best painting in the litter or at least the painting most appropriate for a museum that was trying to appeal to a broader audience that the rich folks who contributed antique piss pots and junk from trips abroad. So it brought a modest price which took me to my next port of call in Elliot Park. For a while there it seemed as if I was moving quite frequently. As when the sales money ran out it was time to sell smaller things at steep discount. But truth be told over the years the Institute and Walker were acquiring work and though it wasn't a living it kept me afloat albeit in the leaky boat of what next??<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp; I started using oils less because the circumstances of my existence didn't always include drying time or money for fancy turpentine and oil colors. Though I did trade a painting for very good oils from a friend in LA, that was a blessing makes me feel like people out West are more friendly more helpful. The art I made was angry at times and dark I recall asking Peter Boswell from the Walker to see a big solo show downtown and he found it very distressing, sad and dark, sort of self evident in the pictures but sometimes you need an expert to give you the honest readout.

It's painted in oils on a storm window an acquaintence of mine traded for it several years back. The work dates from the mid 1980's when I began a long spell of sexual imaging. I was in mid-divorce from my 2nd wife and pissed as much at myself as at her. She was 14 years younger than me and at times it seemed like much more that that time and wisdom wise. The break-up was sort of inevitable given our differences and our different desires. But I was soon packing up at the art school after 17 years of low wages and less than no support from the institution. It was kind of an overdose of art school after spending almost 6 years as a student and having been in an art program in high school I'd been in art school for way too long. So though I didn't agree with the grounds for my non-renewal I didn't call a lawyer I just figured my run was over. After my severence ran out and my unemployment I began living off my art work as best I could.You make more sales when you have too than when you are on the art teacher dole. The first big sale was the Shinder family buying a big painting for the Minneapolis Institute of Arts in 1990-1. Evan Maurer picked the best painting in the litter or at least the painting most appropriate for a museum that was trying to appeal to a broader audience that the rich folks who contributed antique piss pots and junk from trips abroad. So it brought a modest price which took me to my next port of call in Elliot Park. For a while there it seemed as if I was moving quite frequently. As when the sales money ran out it was time to sell smaller things at steep discount. But truth be told over the years the Institute and Walker were acquiring work and though it wasn't a living it kept me afloat albeit in the leaky boat of what next??<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; I started using oils less because the circumstances of my existence didn't always include drying time or money for fancy turpentine and oil colors. Though I did trade a painting for very good oils from a friend in LA, that was a blessing makes me feel like people out West are more friendly more helpful. The art I made was angry at times and dark I recall asking Peter Boswell from the Walker to see a big solo show downtown and he found it very distressing, sad and dark, sort of self evident in the pictures but sometimes you need an expert to give you the honest readout. I started the portraits in the same time frame and they were supposed to make me some income but instead I saw myself doing another type of art with the same commercial results ie. NO&nbsp;SALE.

This can be a very frosty town when you are out of fashion. It's been nice to have more converstion with Stu, we used to prop each other up when we were trying to make some noise with Man Bag .

It was very convincing arguement Greenburg fronted that&nbsp; Pollock had set the outside limits of control and radicality of abstraction. And I agreed Pollock was the new number one but the image was left as abstraction. The image was tainted by it's very subjectivity it could'nt be formal or quantified like a Frank Stella painting.

The image thing is more dicey aside from the Pop Art imaging a lot of new images appeared as did more formal art works like Donald Judd and Smithson etc. The field was beginning to become more complex and more diverse. Peter Saul who I knew briefly in my last term in graduate school at CCAC he was a visiting artist at the San Francisco art school and arts aand crafts in Oakland.

It's exciting and the book looks very sweet and hot. It costs 20 Euros for 112 pages most in color printed by silkscreen. The first book we did with Pakito in 1999 was a Man Bag compilation, this one is more varied though also very pornographic. But it has a pony or two for balance. The book is named <strong>Men<\/strong> <strong>Beg<\/strong>. And boy do they! 1000 copies it will be out of print quickly as was the last.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<input type=\"hidden\" id=\"gwProxy\"><!--Session data--><\/input><input type=\"hidden\" id=\"jsProxy\" onclick=\"jsCall();\" \/>\r\n<div id=\"refHTML\">&nbsp;<\/div>","class":"body","label":"body","is_multiple":false},"created":{"id":"created","content":"1303300091","raw":"1303318091","class":"created","label":"date","is_multiple":false},"nid":{"id":"nid","content":"733","raw":"733","class":"nid","label":"Nid","is_multiple":false},"path":{"id":"path","content":"\/blog\/time-and-its-consequences-men-beg","raw":null,"class":"path","label":"path","is_multiple":false}},{"title":{"id":"title","content":"More of less","raw":"More of less ","class":"title","label":"title","is_multiple":false},"body":{"id":"body","content":"<p>&nbsp;Greetings art lovers - Blogging ain't easy, uh huh uh huh. Art at best is easy as pie indeed these days it might be the pie. I remember the first time I saw the films of the liberation of the concentration camps in newsreels at the neighborhood cinema.It was like looking at the human condition and realizing the depth of the hatred in this world. Why the Jews were scapegoated over and over in history, made demons by the propaganda machine. I remember those newsreels put the fear in me about life and about difference because difference seems always an issue as now with Muslims who have become demonized the way the Communists were the boogieman after the war. Same goes for artists who are seen by some elements in the society as little more than bums. A threat to the order of things the prioritization of work requires workers who give their youth and good health to the boss man and as they age are castoff and replaced by younger healthier workers. In some ways the art trade has become very academic, indeed sometimes it seems like no one makes art without a steady teaching gig. And the best of the students are apt to have teaching gigs themselves one day, no tenure no benefits hired semester by semester for years without long term contracts. Academic freedom by definition requires tenure as a prerequistite for freedom to teach and do research. But even as the profession became more academic it also became less free. Freedom of speech such a basic freedom and most especially in an art school seems everywhere to be dangerous, controversy attends art work rich with content and brimming over with life! We live in a giant passive aggressive society that doesn't wish to be reminded of it's shortcomings including the shortcomings of art and schools of art. Truth in art the sort of Rosetta Stone of the practice of art seems to have been kicked to the curb by a narcissum the West has about it's culture, it's awful films and brainless television. Art is a criticism in the sense that it offers alternative visions of how things could be. I recall during the Vietnam era when many of the minimalist artist rose to prominence that it struck me that that art was a sort of corporate abstraction, an emblom of the state's power, Frank Stella made sweetly designed paintings that had next to nothing to do with the world he lived in, it was as if art no longer had to do with real things with the suffering in South East Asian of which we were the author. And the empty geometries filled the space where art might be if they weren't already drafting artists into that insane slaughter whilst the successful corporate astractionists became rich men and the work became just too hip for words , styling covering the image of a horrible war that drained our country of moral substance and left us vacant. Hence God Save The Queen and her facist regime - of the SexPistols. The darkness of our culture always has a sweet cover, the decoration takes our minds away from the genocidal actions of the governments, abstraction as done by minimalists is a camouflage it keeps our politics pure and imageless. It's not that abstraction should be abandoned but rather the image itself of humans should not be seen as a lesser thing less important that these giant geometric objects sitting outside corporate headquarters or begetting yardage awards at museums, most square feet of geometric decoration. The image artist can be quite abstract but somehow the image is never entirely forsaken. The work tends to be smaller more intimate and more humanistic. When I was young I tried to make heroic New York style paintings with tiny images. I wanted to see if the two schools could be brought into one work. That painting is up at the Walker Art Center now in an exhibition named Midnight Party designed by Joan Rothfuss. That painting drove me insane day by day until really understood that the price we pay for our investigations is often greater than we suspect. I'm not sorry I made the giant painting or the nearly two years it took to make it or that it engendered my madness and my recovery over several more years no I think you have to do something like this to find your way into yourself, into your life. My intelligence was never in question but my sanity was because I just sailed too far into my own vision, I found myself discovering the sort of artist I had become, I was fearless but I was defeated by my own limitations as a human. Was it worth it? I'm still working on my project, I'm still engaged by my ideas and I still feel like my work is never done.But some small rewards have come, and I've always felt the artist is digging forward towards a more beautiful and more just outcome. We each tour this world named our life, we do what we do and we perish and leave somethings behind, maybe I knew this before most of you because you just know you have to do your work before time runs out.

When Walker Hopps did a small retrospective of Duchamp at the Pasadena Art Museum Duchamp was quite an old gentleman. The thing was his influence was enormous and influence is as important to an artist as the actual work surviving. Apelles the most famous Greek painter of the classical age is more stories than paintings, nothing of his great work has survived but he becomes immortal in the eyes of the poets and philosophers who tell the tale of this amazing painter. Duchamp lost a lot his work along life's way, some of the readymades were just lost undervalued because they were common objects like snowshovels and bicyclewheels.

These replicas are now bringing huge prices at auction when they are up for sale. In most ways every artist has a late reception unless they are like Picasso and become the apple of many eyes early on, the late reception is something to do with many factors.

And all with his petit sensation which he accused Gauguin as stealing.

You find this palette in Courbet this earthy brown and weedy green orches and rusts and lots of black. Some modernists saw the prismatic nature of Cezanne and painted less earthy colors and rarely black. It was the beginning of the division between retinal artists and so-called non-retinal artists like Marcel Duchamp. Coming out of Cubism color arrived in various emphasises.

Tolouse Lautrec's paintings were a sort of art portal for me, his pictures seemed to portray another world and time so vividly that it became my greatest desire to inhabit my art the way he did and very few artists ever have , his art posits a glowing living moving world of dancing and partying in Paris in the late 19th century. Picasso as a young painter made highly Lautrec-like paintings, Lautrec had influence on many artists then and now. His art is so much a picture of his own world his bower of the Moulin Rouge the great stewpot of modernism and of the coming age (the 20th century). Art history requires us to dig about to uncover the true story of an artist or a movement or an epoch. Each of us has their own version of the history of art, a subjective version of the facts that meant the most to us that greased our slide into the unsettling life of an artist. For me the color and modulation of light in paintings has always held me in it's spell. As much in the morning light and shade of an Edward Hopper clapboard building drenched in sun and shadow or in Lautrec's incredible effects and confections of color. It devolves to a question about meaning, what do feelings mean what do we seek in art? In theater we seek the catharsis, not so much meaning,in art we sort of find an odd acceptance , this is what I feel as with the what outcome awaits us when we visit Monet's Waterlilies at MoMA, we are surrendering to the art (or not). Meaning is a gnarly concept it has thorns , the narrative say of Vincent van Gogh his suffering his ear etc but they paintings are joyous, he obviously could speak clearly in his idiom, his painting are joy incarnate. Life can be good when a baby is born what joy what happiness, when you win the glittering prize when you meet a great love. And for the artist the work becomes the vessel of emotion and thought. For all the literature about Paul Cezanne as a structuralist a formalist the great architect of early modernism etc. the truth be seen his paintings are raptuously beautiful, sensual and just sublime. They are objects of great luminousity and hue. The contrast between his formal aspect and his sensuality was his main struggle and it was never quite resolved itself and all the better for we consumers of his beauties. Duchamp thought the retinal art (impressionism. post-impressionism)which preceeded modernism as cubism (earth colors dominate cubist paintings) was the true calling of art, an art in the service of the mind and so did Cezanne, he was the first to express the desire to put art in the service of the mind. I for one think the nihilism of the great war period and afterwards was a very big factor in the development of early modernism. But what does it mean? Ha, it means art is not seperate from world it inhabits, The binary nature of our existence plays out in our art, maybe I see things more intensely because of my brain disorder or my tumultuous life?

This was comforting I think because as a teacher I knew many people and not many of them for long times save some of the Artpolice gang and some old pals from Chicago. And a few people who I really liked and looked forward to talking with and seeing now and then. I never understood why this dysfunction was particular to Bi-Polar people. I know some of it is just time and how time transforms us and success too is often hard on friendships, my friend Joe Zucker let go of our friendship in 1989 and I had a long relationship with him going back to art school in the mid 1960's. In some ways I understand Joe's behavior and I accepted the outcome though to me it was the old problem of being frank with wrong person. Joe and I were artist friends not so much friends like casual pals, we were ambitious artists in our youth and we both had very different lives. I admire Joe and his art but long before the break I knew it was not good Joe was very successful in New York and he was able to doi ambitious work and not have to teach much. He's brilliant his analysis of contemporary art is spellbinding. He was an inspiration for me like Peter Saul was only more long term. A couple of my first professional exhibitions were thanks to Joe's aegis and the group show at Silverstein Gallery I always recall because it was in the old Biograph Theater in Chicago wher John Dillinger, Public Enemy No. 1 was killed&nbsp; and where Joseph Beuys had his photo taken on his 1974 US tour. Beuys liked being thought of as a bad ass hence his racoon coat and big cigars. Anyway I miss Joe I disagree with his judgement but I respect it. \/\/\/\/\/\/\/ Part of it devolves to a remark the late Gus Gustafson made to me during a photo shoot. It was me complaining about a womanfriend and Gus reminded me in a amusing manner that I had more partners than most gents. And this reminds me first to think that Bi-Polars are more sexual than normal folks, indeed it's hard to kill yourself when you have lots of sexual pleasure, yes sex is an antidepressant! Or at least it's a distraction from one's fate or problems ( insert John Lydon singing Problems, the problem is you!) .

You have to take risks to live and to make art as well even more so because Amerika is not interested in art say as much as football or pornography or fashion. Art is very slippery. It waxes and wanes. Today's hero is tomorrow's fool and the fickleness of the rich is another factor that multiplies the risk. I think the art schools are dishonest because if they told the truth they would have fewer students. But it's the liberal democracy where everyone has a chance at success which is at base another lie with good intentions. More honest a prescription would be to survive you must be ruthless , you must use any means necessary to survive (Caravaggio murdered someone to keep his freedom). And make no bones about it doesn't sit well with the moralists , the keepers of the temple so you wind up suffering your own decision to keep at it. I say boy I am tired of all the recieved wisdom we do what we need to do to eat to and to make our work, the work changes as the world changes. Art making is a rather intellectual process the studio is a laboratory at times. We are looking for something that is hard to describe, a kind of experiment which may not always bear fruit. No I miss my old friends who are gone but I know that's the way life is and if you want to make art you just may not be easy to live with - your behavior may be at odds with your society but hey without the risk taking no David Wojnarowicz , no way home it's as if we only can survive by not being afraid to speak our minds. Fear is a terrible thing but freedom is more important to artists than success . Freedom is an experiment. Just remember how Nietzsche wrote about the herd. Artists leave the flock, they try to make work in the face of an indifferent audience. Which is maybe why the greatest common thread between artists is the love of art.<\/p>\n<p><input type=\"hidden\" id=\"gwProxy\" \/><\/p>\n<!--Session data--><!--Session data--><p><input type=\"hidden\" id=\"jsProxy\" onclick=\"jsCall();\" \/><\/p>\n<div id=\"refHTML\">&nbsp;<\/div>","raw":"<p>&nbsp;Lately I think about life as a tour and as you age you start your farewell tour before you vanish forever.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;I've lost alot of friends along the way, I had a psychiatrist Dr. Coldmorning ( he saw me for free and gave me my lithium for free )anyway he told me how Bi-Polar people have trouble with relationships romantic and otherwise. This was comforting I think because as a teacher I knew many people and not many of them for long times save some of the Artpolice gang and some old pals from Chicago. And a few people who I really liked and looked forward to talking with and seeing now and then. I never understood why this dysfunction was particular to Bi-Polar people. I know some of it is just time and how time transforms us and success too is often hard on friendships, my friend Joe Zucker let go of our friendship in 1989 and I had a long relationship with him going back to art school in the mid 1960's. In some ways I understand Joe's behavior and I accepted the outcome though to me it was the old problem of being frank with wrong person. Joe and I were artist friends not so much friends like casual pals, we were ambitious artists in our youth and we both had very different lives. I admire Joe and his art but long before the break I knew it was not good Joe was very successful in New York and he was able to doi ambitious work and not have to teach much. He's brilliant his analysis of contemporary art is spellbinding. He was an inspiration for me like Peter Saul was only more long term. A couple of my first professional exhibitions were thanks to Joe's aegis and the group show at Silverstein Gallery I always recall because it was in the old Biograph Theater in Chicago wher John Dillinger, Public Enemy No. 1 was killed&nbsp; and where Joseph Beuys had his photo taken on his 1974 US tour. Beuys liked being thought of as a bad ass hence his racoon coat and big cigars. Anyway I miss Joe I disagree with his judgement but I respect it. \/\/\/\/\/\/\/ Part of it devolves to a remark the late Gus Gustafson made to me during a photo shoot. It was me complaining about a womanfriend and Gus reminded me in a amusing manner that I had more partners than most gents. And this reminds me first to think that Bi-Polars are more sexual than normal folks, indeed it's hard to kill yourself when you have lots of sexual pleasure, yes sex is an antidepressant! Or at least it's a distraction from one's fate or problems ( insert John Lydon singing Problems, the problem is you!) .

I think Klein fills the bill for an artist who fortells some of the future art we live with now I for one think he is an important percursor on Chris Burden's art and in general the abstract monochromatic painting that has continued to be an important part of modernist praxis, and in most ways Klein's early monochromes are what I enjoy most in his work and what I think looks most contemporary and has aged best of his works. But it's hard to keep contemporary when you've been dead for48 years.&nbsp; <\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p><strong><input type=\"hidden\" id=\"gwProxy\"><!--Session data--><\/input><input type=\"hidden\" id=\"jsProxy\" onclick=\"jsCall();\" \/><\/strong><\/p>\r\n<div id=\"refHTML\">&nbsp;<\/div>","class":"body","label":"body","is_multiple":false},"created":{"id":"created","content":"1290604112","raw":"1290622112","class":"created","label":"date","is_multiple":false},"nid":{"id":"nid","content":"687","raw":"687","class":"nid","label":"Nid","is_multiple":false},"path":{"id":"path","content":"\/blog\/return-wastebook-still-thinking-about-yves-klein","raw":null,"class":"path","label":"path","is_multiple":false}},{"title":{"id":"title","content":"WARNING POSSIBLE BLOG ABORT  - we&#039;ve run aground!-Wastebook to take over email","raw":"WARNING POSSIBLE BLOG ABORT  - we've run aground!-Wastebook to take over email","class":"title","label":"title","is_multiple":false},"body":{"id":"body","content":"<p>This is the story of my three sons, or part of the story since the story goes on in actual time.

By now one realizes we sold the top artist position to the Europeans currently held by Sigmar Polke<\/p>\n<p>It's as if the market has been flooded with Euro art. All the stars of earlier booms present again. Beuys still dead but his museal quality still makes curators leak a little in his underpants.

By now one realizes we sold the top artist position to the Europeans currently held by Sigmar Polke<\/p>\r\n<p>It's as if the market has been flooded with Euro art. All the stars of earlier booms present again. Beuys still dead but his museal quality still makes curators leak a little in his underpants. Oh my G-d I smelled Beuys in the Reliquary in St Joseph's felt cathedral. You get me a European art dealer and we will do bidniss . Just the Artpolice originals collection being shot for this web-site blog. Another collection too of erotic watercolors some making fun of Sigmar Polke's art(shown in Berlin 2004).All this and more soon or slightly less soon. So these aliens are here mostly to steal art, load it on the cargo ends of these lithium light star salvage ship.

My sales were terrible most all of the 1990's I think I have no customers here , I'm just too out-there, too much for the nice community I resides in, nice people doing good things for the underpriviledged . The TC is really the very poor and the folks with Netflix, it's the solution the rich always dreamed of work and leisure and newsbites to keep us global. Sometimes it seems like the problems of the poor have never been solved , maybe it's just beyond fixing sort of like a bigger Haiti, we all decline slowly as the world returns to it's chaos of origin.&nbsp; I've seen it all my days the poor are used to further ambitions like Clinton signing the Welfare Reform Act. Which has followed Clinton like an albatross . The tragedy of our sweet land was trading people as slaves and over time we made work a sort of slavery-lite. Working for the man every nite and day! My desire to make art I knew would make my life difficult at times, because my income would always be small &lt;&nbsp;Even Artpolice was a dollar, food money, beer money weed money but never a living&gt; things is the TC will buy records and concerts and plays but a painting oh my so dear so much too much maybe next year. And their is a trickle down, my kids had less. I saw an old film of MLK talking about a guarranteed income for poor people, sounds so rad now after years of right wing politicians using welfare as a weapon against the poor. But the health care premiums are up some almost 40% because people can't afford coverage so the pool is smaller and the rates go up. Same with no income incomes it hurts everybody. and most wickedly children food and food aid become a currency as in Haiti. &nbsp; Art is part of life not seperate from life. If they can have a revolution in Iran maybe we could have a little one here?

My sales were terrible most all of the 1990's I think I have no customers here , I'm just too out-there, too much for the nice community I resides in, nice people doing good things for the underpriviledged . The TC is really the very poor and the folks with Netflix, it's the solution the rich always dreamed of work and leisure and newsbites to keep us global. Sometimes it seems like the problems of the poor have never been solved , maybe it's just beyond fixing sort of like a bigger Haiti, we all decline slowly as the world returns to it's chaos of origin.&nbsp; I've seen it all my days the poor are used to further ambitions like Clinton signing the Welfare Reform Act. Which has followed Clinton like an albatross . The tragedy of our sweet land was trading people as slaves and over time we made work a sort of slavery-lite. Working for the man every nite and day! My desire to make art I knew would make my life difficult at times, because my income would always be small &lt;&nbsp;Even Artpolice was a dollar, food money, beer money weed money but never a living&gt; things is the TC will buy records and concerts and plays but a painting oh my so dear so much too much maybe next year. And their is a trickle down, my kids had less. I saw an old film of MLK talking about a guarranteed income for poor people, sounds so rad now after years of right wing politicians using welfare as a weapon against the poor. But the health care premiums are up some almost 40% because people can't afford coverage so the pool is smaller and the rates go up. Same with no income incomes it hurts everybody. and most wickedly children food and food aid become a currency as in Haiti. &nbsp; Art is part of life not seperate from life. If they can have a revolution in Iran maybe we could have a little one here? Just enough so people can go take their kids to the doctor and still have money to feed them later.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>I&nbsp;LOVE&nbsp;THE&nbsp;FUCKING&nbsp;WALKER<\/strong><\/p>","class":"body","label":"body","is_multiple":false},"created":{"id":"created","content":"1267448035","raw":"1267466035","class":"created","label":"date","is_multiple":false},"nid":{"id":"nid","content":"607","raw":"607","class":"nid","label":"Nid","is_multiple":false},"path":{"id":"path","content":"\/blog\/walker-art-center-truck-coming-thursday","raw":null,"class":"path","label":"path","is_multiple":false}},{"title":{"id":"title","content":"RIGHT ON","raw":"RIGHT ON ","class":"title","label":"title","is_multiple":false},"body":{"id":"body","content":"<p>Right on <strong>right on<\/strong> I always thought <strong>right o<\/strong><strong>n<\/strong> was just perfect for it's time.

Funny I should prefer Cornell to Jasper Johns my youthful favorite. Johns I don't think will be as big in posterity as he is to this&nbsp; world. It's good but the thrill is gone for me. Johns just got lost. Whereas Cornell burns brighter than ever, long live mystery. <\/p>\r\n<input type=\"hidden\" id=\"gwProxy\"><!--Session data--><\/input><input type=\"hidden\" id=\"jsProxy\" onclick=\"jsCall();\" \/>\r\n<div id=\"refHTML\">&nbsp;<\/div>","class":"body","label":"body","is_multiple":false},"created":{"id":"created","content":"1262691191","raw":"1262709191","class":"created","label":"date","is_multiple":false},"nid":{"id":"nid","content":"582","raw":"582","class":"nid","label":"Nid","is_multiple":false},"path":{"id":"path","content":"\/blog\/frankygaardyahoocom-new-book-numbers","raw":null,"class":"path","label":"path","is_multiple":false}},{"title":{"id":"title","content":"After the year is over","raw":"After the year is over","class":"title","label":"title","is_multiple":false},"body":{"id":"body","content":"<p>I was 22 when I met my first curator, he was a Dutchman who worked at the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis.

I remember being surprised that so many people did'nt&nbsp; most particularly in California. Writing needs the reader in a way similar to the picture needing a viewer it completes the piece. Better reading, dipping in Lolita from years,<\/p>\r\n<p>Lolita is such an incredible book, it brings a time to life and a fucked up pedophile is the main story- I like James Mason as Humbert in Kubrick's Lolita.I feel sometimes the world needs a boy Lolita maybe from Thai LadyBoys - I like description very elaborate and precise descriptions. Part of Lolita is the dawning of millions of Nyphettes all the time, cops and robbers with children and pedophiles. Lolita projects a future as bleak as ours where children are preyed upon.But it's also a sort of an obsession of the culture lately. Art can give us a sense of balance or disequilibrium you don't know it's there sometimes until you're surrounded by it. DuChamp still surprises people and me too. Plus it's a gentle message about not taking ourselves so seriously.

She grew up on a farm in the upper penisula of Michigan during the Depression in a community that spoke mostly Finnish. Finnish is a language that is very difficult almost an Asian language. The Finns came to Northern Europe from Mongolia. I recall my drunken father calling my Mom a Mongolian when they fought (she called him a draft dodger, he'd spend most of the war in Trinidad drinking rum and unloading cargo). I wondered if I was a Chinaman? If this was the dirty lil' secret, John had married a Mongolian though my mom was very attractive ; she used to say peeps told her she looked like Ingrid Bergman.

I've been taking lithium carbonate since 1978, it's my conviction that everyone is a bit nuts some more than others and some wildly fucked up. The lithium cured me though I still don't respond to stress very, well who does? Once when my sister and I were waiting for the paddy wagon to take mom to the hospital I had my mother make a drawing called &quot;Party Time in The Yukon&quot;,. trying to distract her by remembering winter in the U.P. which has fierce winters .Distraction and digression are ways you lure people into a different pattern of thought. Teaching me teaching made my mother proud that her boy was a teacher made her feel like something had gone right in our family. Of course teaching fine art isn't the same as teaching 3rd grade. It was a step up from laboring, her dad and brothers worked in the White Pine Copper Mines and her husband was a union painter in Chicago. Meanwhile I was trying to figure out how to teach art to semi-literate students who really did'nt know much save they all liked Pink Floyd. I started teaching reading, as I realized I was over educated (for them) it was as if I was talking a different language. As I had found in Wittgenstein the limits of one's language are the limits of one's world. The students didn't have basic language skills, they couldn't talk about their work indeed&nbsp; my perception was they resorted to pictures because they couldn't make sentences .I know this sounds critical but I was trying to help them think, to reason and to make them better able to enter into a serious encounter with art. The thing is of course the drugs and the easy wisdom of intoxication complicated teaching. But if someone earnestly wanted to learn I could help and I could give them a sense of scale , the immensity of knowledge comes a surprise to an 18 year old. My mom ran more on the emotional track than on the intellectual but the emotional life she had was incredibily rich. Alice was sensitive maybe way past sensitive.

Truth is love is the main ingredient in learning and in art. If you really care it makes anything&nbsp; easier to do. The danger is this idea that you are somehow above criticism, that you become so great that mere criticism rolls off your back. When the truth is if you get no response then the work is&nbsp; not touching people, like a lamp that wouldn't light up after you repair it you need to try again, to find away to bridge the gap between yourself and others. Because the reponse of the viewer is the completion of the art work. Elsewise it's masturbation of a sort playing with art making rather than making something bigger than the self.

It was a pretty cool show but I think it also had some resale elements and maybe it was Gagosian? Or Doug Chrismas? My memory ain't so fabulous as it was;so I have a very hard time with big money art,artists collectors etc. Maybe cuz I'm a lefty, like my Mom I don't see what war gains us. And an artist population never forms a community because we are so short on capital, nobody has much (a crappy art teacher gig for small potatoes salary)<\/p>\n<p>Art is more reliable more the steadyman in this economic inversion. Value was an obsession for Nietzsche , how is it that we value things one thing more than another ? Nietzsche spoke of a new system of values, a values above values. The whole thing in art is how difficult it is to determine value. You also know that the whole question is what matters and what matters most? I think we create worlds, odd little worlds with different viewpoints. Like my mom listening to Fats Domino whilst ironing shirts I recall thinking I'll always remember this!!

I remember seeing a Chris Burden show in Los Angeles , alot of documents were available snapshots of his arm wound from the shooting performance, you could see the white fats and tissue bulging out of the wound. It was a pretty cool show but I think it also had some resale elements and maybe it was Gagosian? Or Doug Chrismas? My memory ain't so fabulous as it was;so I have a very hard time with big money art,artists collectors etc. Maybe cuz I'm a lefty, like my Mom I don't see what war gains us. And an artist population never forms a community because we are so short on capital, nobody has much (a crappy art teacher gig for small potatoes salary)<\/p>\r\n<p>Art is more reliable more the steadyman in this economic inversion. Value was an obsession for Nietzsche , how is it that we value things one thing more than another ? Nietzsche spoke of a new system of values, a values above values. The whole thing in art is how difficult it is to determine value. You also know that the whole question is what matters and what matters most? I think we create worlds, odd little worlds with different viewpoints. Like my mom listening to Fats Domino whilst ironing shirts I recall thinking I'll always remember this!! No sale the only sale.<\/p>\r\n<input type=\"hidden\" id=\"gwProxy\"><!--Session data--><\/input><input type=\"hidden\" id=\"jsProxy\" onclick=\"jsCall();\" \/>\r\n<div id=\"refHTML\">&nbsp;<\/div>","class":"body","label":"body","is_multiple":false},"created":{"id":"created","content":"1256675972","raw":"1256693972","class":"created","label":"date","is_multiple":false},"nid":{"id":"nid","content":"539","raw":"539","class":"nid","label":"Nid","is_multiple":false},"path":{"id":"path","content":"\/blog\/air","raw":null,"class":"path","label":"path","is_multiple":false}},{"title":{"id":"title","content":"Cold Rain and Keats","raw":"Cold Rain and Keats","class":"title","label":"title","is_multiple":false},"body":{"id":"body","content":"<p>Saw the new Keats movie really seemed like the Fanny movie but that's Jane Campion always giving the woman's viewpoint.Point here being the necessity of language skills for visual artists.After years of studying Nietzsche I found poetry.
